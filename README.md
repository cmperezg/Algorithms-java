# Algorithms-java
java version of the algorithms in repository "Algorithms"

The class "Sorts" includes a simple implementation of several sorting algorithms 
so that they can be understood and implemented without any confusors.

The same algorithms are implemented in the repository "Algorithms", but since that code 
includes a graphic representation and animations, the algorithm itself is harder to understand
